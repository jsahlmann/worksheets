## CLT for means

The distribution of sample statistics is nearly normal, centered at the population mean, and with a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by square root of the sample size.

$$ \bar{x} \sim N \left(mean = \mu, SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right) $$

The standard error of the mean is $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.

## CLT for proportions

The distribution of sample proportions is nearly normal, centered at the population proportion, and with a standard error inversely proportional to the sample size.


$$ \hat{p} \sim N\left(mean = p, SE = \sqrt{  \frac{p(1-p)}{n}  } \right) $$

The standard error of a proportion is  $\sqrt{  \frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}  }$
